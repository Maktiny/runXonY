# runXonY

A timeline tree about  run X on Y.

X and Y could be soft/hardware, and any layers in computers' world.

This project was initially meant to track BT (Binary Translation) techs, while as time goes by, I found more and more related non-BT techs tangled with BT techs. All these BT and non-BT techs' goals are to run soft/hardware on different platform. So I change project's goal from "tracking BT techs" to "tracking runXonY techs".
